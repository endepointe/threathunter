# ThreatHunter

A modular tool for auditing hybrid environments.


## Overview

**ThreatHunter** is an open-source framework designed for on-prem and cloud environments. 

* Continuously ingests logs, cloud events, telemetry, and container behavior from multiple clients, called Silos.
* Correlates activity against **MITRE TTPs** using a knowledge graph in a central Hub.
* Uses **recon**: curated detection queries.
* Integrates with **OSINT feeds**, **CTI platforms**, and **Sigma rules** for threat-analysis.
* Generate reports of a Silos activity.
* Terminal and Web interfaces for framework management.

## Recon 

Modular YAML-based detection rules, aligned to MITRE ATT\&CK.

Example:

```yaml
id: T1059.003
name: Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell
query: SELECT * FROM sysmon_logs WHERE event_data LIKE '%cmd.exe%'
platform: windows
severity: high
confidence: 80
```

* Stored in: `recon/`
* Categories: `initial-access/`, `lateral-movement/`, `persistence/`, etc.

Build your own or contribute via PR.

## Simulate Adversaries (Red Team)

Integrate Atomic Red Team or Caldera to simulate:

* Credential dumping
* Cloud misconfigurations
* Reverse shells inside containers

```bash
./scripts/simulate T1548.001   # Run a privilege escalation test
```

## Query Engine Support

| Engine      | Description                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| KQL (tbd)         | Azure Sentinel, Microsoft Defender |
| SPL (tbd)        | Splunk                             |
| SQL        | PostgreSQL, SQLite (via `osquery`) |
| Elastic DSL (tbd)| ElasticSearch queries              |
